# Source code for website

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) is used for syntax highlighting.

*Update (6 October 2025): after a good 2665 days, this Hugo version of the site hosted on Netlify will be retired but still up for posterity's sake. Source code for "new" version which looks almost exactly the same here (still served at the same URL chenhuijing.com). Unless you have been stalking my site daily or have a photographic memory, you probably cannot tell what changed visually.*
